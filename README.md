Play a planarian worm and cut your enemies to survive !
You can test is now on your navigator [here](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alexandre.variengien/PlanarWar.html) !

## Build and Install instruction :

This project was developed with the videogames programming library [Raylib](www.raylib.com).
It can be compiled with make and gcc under Linux or Windows (with mingw32-make for example).
Simply tip "make run" to build and play !

It uses shared libraries (.dll for windows and .so for Linux to keep in the same directory 
as the executable).

There is also a Code::Blocks project included that uses Release and Debug directories in /bin and /obj.

The game is also available online at [http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alexandre.variengien/PlanarWar.html](http://perso.ens-lyon.fr/alexandre.variengien/PlanarWar.html). 
This web version was compiled into WebAssembly with Emscripten and Raylib for web.

Enjoy !
