---------------- #PlanarWar by Alexandre Variengien ---------------

###Description :

Play a planarian worm and cut your enemies to survive !



###Build and Install instruction :

This project was developed with the videogames programming library Raylib (www.raylib.com).
It can be compiled with make and gcc under Linux or Windows (with mingw32-make for example).
Simply tip "make run" to build and play !

It uses shared libraries (.dll for windows and .so for Linux to keep in the same directory 
as the executable).

There is also a Code::Blocks project included that uses Release and Debug directories in /bin and /obj.

The game is also available online at perso.ens-lyon/alexandre.variengien/

Enjoy !
